# Gym-management-django
As my final year project at my bachelor , digitalizing a gym is essential for optimizing product and service sales while facilitating communication and engagement through digital tools, thus providing a better experience for members. The FFC project aims to develop a comprehensive web platform for gym management. The main objectives are to optimize the sale of complementary products by integrating an online system for selling dietary supplements and other fitness-related products, improve member communication and engagement by creating an interactive blog section where gym clients and experts can share articles, ensure efficient information management by providing administrative tools to publish news and statuses, and manage memberships and reservations centrally. Additionally, the platform aims to offer an intuitive interface for users to easily subscribe to packages and book sessions with coaches, and facilitate communication among gym clients.
